# Description
This daily planner application allows the user to create and save a schedule for the current day, including time blocks for standard business hours. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. The user can enter an event for each time block, and the text for that event is saved in local storage when the save button is clicked. The saved events will persist even after the page is refreshed.

# Installation
To install the application, simply download or clone the repository from GitHub.

# Usage
To use the application, open the index.html file in a web browser. The current day will be displayed at the top of the calendar, and time blocks for standard business hours will be presented as the user scrolls down. Click into a time block to enter an event, and click the save button to save the event to local storage. The color of each time block will update in real time to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
